## How to submit your site

**Add the webring links to your site first**, then fork this repo, add
your site's name and URL to the
[sites.js](https://github.com/Shadytel/webring/blob/master/sites.js)
file, and send a pull request.

## How to add the webring to your site

If you want in, you should display your webring links with
pride. Rather than require scripts and injecting hard to override HTML
into your carefully crafted site, you can style your links however you
want.  Make them weird, beautiful, nostalgic, minimalistic,
outrageous, whimsicle, mysterious, fragrant, terrifying, or covered in
hot butter. Just make it yours.

**All you need to do is add the following links to your site somewhere:**

| Link Description | URL |
|---|---|
| Previous site | `https://shady.tel/ring/prev.html` |
| Next site | `https://shady.tel/ring/next.html` |
| Random site | `https://shady.tel/ring/random.html` |
| List all sites | `https://shady.tel/ring` |

The link will work out your position in the list and redirect visitors to the next site in the webring.

## Links API

You can retrieve a list of the webring links (next/previous/random/list/join) as either an HTML unstyled-list partial or a JSON file from:

* [HTML](https://shady.tel/ring/links.html)
* [JSON](https://shady.tel/ring/links.json)

## Privacy First

We don't collect or store any information beyond the list of sites themselves. This is for fun, not for profit.
